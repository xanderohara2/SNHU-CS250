    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
They help to interpret user needs, gather their feedback and translate it into specific “user stories.” These stories break down features from the user’s view, making it clearer what to build.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach development by understanding the problem and step by step building and testing. I plan to use Agile practices like sprints and regular feedback to keep the project on track and aligned with pfuture user needs.

    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating well, collaborating, and supporting one another. It’s about sharing knowledge, helping out, and being reliable to help the team succeed.
